# TODO 10: Webserver as a thread
# TODO 11: TUI: List project and url as a navlist tree on left
# TODO 12: TUI: Url editor

# TODO Backlog:
# - Add Request type handle - GET
# - Url list in a project
# - Activate / deactivate a route
# - give an array of every field as param to route_inv functions with a checker
# - Each route must be identified with a UUID not by path (Allow multiple dÃ©finition for a same route (if own route is set as on, another routes are set to off))
# - Dynamic route with params that can be used in reply (like /plop/:id => Reply: your id is :id)
# - Fast exec, just give the json config file as path and deserv defined paths
# - Shared inventory between users

# TODO To be clean:
# - LOGGING_LEVEL as env var + correspondance table between our and logging variable type
# - Comments
